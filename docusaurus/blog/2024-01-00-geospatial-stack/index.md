## 1. The Data


![map_data_points](./map_data_points.png 'map_data_points')

## 2. PostGIS

### `ST_Distance`

ST_Distance can be used to find the minimum distance between two points. This approach can be extended in a recursive manner to many points.

- Elephant: Hour of the day with the highest average distance traveled (meters) per year?

### `ST_Contains`

ST_Contains checks whether a given geometry A contains another geometry B.

- Throughout the study, how many times did the elephant enter Dassioko Village? Is there a particular year, month, day, time of day, where this was most frequent?

### `ST_ConcaveHull`, `ST_InteriorRingN`

ST_ConcaveHull can be used to establish a boundary around a set of points, while also allowing for gaps (known as holes). ST_InteriorRingN can then be used to identify these holes.

- On visual inspection, there appears to be an area of avoidance in the top left region of the dataset. Can this be identified with a query?

## 3. Summary
Using Temboâ€™s Geospatial Stack, we were able to explore a GPS tracking dataset. Though this demonstration focused on the movements of a single elephant, it should be noted that the showcased PostGIS functions have numerous applications to other, business-centric projects:
- Loading and exploring geospatial datasets
- Insights on time-of-day activity
- Insights on avoidance behavior
- Insights on behavior related to pre-determined areas (zones)
