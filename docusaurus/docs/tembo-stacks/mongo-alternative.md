# Tembo MongoAlternative

The Tembo MongoAlternative Stack is designed to bring document-oriented database capabilities to Postgres.
Leveraging the power of FerretDB, Tembo users can both migrate from MongoDB to Postgres, but can also interact with their data as if they never left!

## Apps

- [FerretDB](https://docs.ferretdb.io/) - `FerretDB` ...

## Getting started

### Sample dataset

### Setup

Once you've established a Tembo MongoAlternative Stack instance, you can copy the connection string from the UI and execute it in your terminal.
Alternatively, you can fill in and run the following mongosh command:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:<your-password>@<your-host>:5432/postgres'
```

```bash
mongosh "mongodb://postgres:<your-password>@<your-host>:27018/ferretdb?authMechanism=PLAIN&tls=true&tlsCaFile=$(pwd)/ca.crt"
```
